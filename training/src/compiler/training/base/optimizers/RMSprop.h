/**
 * @brief RMSprop algorithm
 *
 * By default, the implementation here takes the square root of the gradient average before
 * adding epsilon (PyTorch behaviour). The effective learning rate is thus :math:`\alpha/(\sqrt{v} + \epsilon)`
 * where :math:`\alpha` is the scheduled learning rate and :math:`v` is the weighted moving average
 * of the squared gradient.
 * Behaviour can be changed to TF by setting tfStyle = true.
 *
 *  @see
 *  - Proposed by G. Hinton in his course: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf
 *  - Centered version: A. Graves - Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850v5.pdf
