/**
 * @brief KLDivLoss (Kullback-Leibler divergence Loss)
 *
 *  KL divergence is a useful distance measure for continuous distributions
 *  and is often useful when performing direct regression
 *  over the space of (discretely sampled) continuous output distributions.
 *  As with NLLLoss, the input given is expected to contain log-probabilities.
 *  Target values (labels) should be given as probabilities.
 *
 *  MEAN reduction works as 'batchmean' in torch
 *  @see
 *  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence
