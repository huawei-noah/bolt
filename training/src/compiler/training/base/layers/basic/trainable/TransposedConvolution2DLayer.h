 * @brief Transposed Convolution 2D Layer
 * Applies a 2D transposed convolution operator over an input image
 * composed of several input planes. This module can be seen as the
 * gradient of Convolution 2D Layer with respect to its input.
 * It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or a deconvolution
 * (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation).
