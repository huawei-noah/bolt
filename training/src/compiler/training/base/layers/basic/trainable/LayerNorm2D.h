 * @brief Layer Normalization
 *
 * An alternative technique to BatchNorm to normalize the distribution of layer outputs that performs exactly the same during training and inference.
 * @see https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450
 * This is a cummulative implementation - mean and variance are calculated along width and height
 * Weights and biases still have size = width
