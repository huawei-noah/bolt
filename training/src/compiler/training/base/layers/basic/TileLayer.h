 * This operation creates a new tensor by replicating input multiples times. The output tensor's i'th dimension
 * has input.dims(i) * multiples[i] elements, and the values of input are replicated multiples[i] times along the 'i'th dimension.
 * If no dimension specified, whole tensor will be replicated, otherwise - only needed dimension.
