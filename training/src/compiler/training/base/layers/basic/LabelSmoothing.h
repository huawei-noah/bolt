/*
 * @brief Label Smoothing
 *
 * The generalization and learning speed of a multi-class neural network can often be significantly improved
 * by using soft targets that are a weighted average of the hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels.
 * Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming over-confident.
 *
 * Implementation accroding to one in ransformer (https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html#label-smoothing):
 *
 * Zero input vectors are a special case and are kept zero.
 *
 * Does nothing in Test Mode (as if smoothing is 0)
 *
 * @see https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629
