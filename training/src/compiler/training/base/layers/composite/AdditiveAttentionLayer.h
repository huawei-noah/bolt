 * @brief Additive Attention Layer
 *
 * This layer is a additive attention layer, a.k.a. Bahdanau-style attention.
 *
 * Implementation follows https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/AdditiveAttention
 *
 * Inputs: Query, Value, Key[, Mask] or Query[, Mask]. In latter case Value=Key=Query
 * Outputs: Attention[, Probabilities]
