Software: jpeg (<http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9d.tar.gz>)

Copyright (c) 1991-2018, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

License: 

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this

software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these

conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,

not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to

acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from

it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of

commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are

assumed by the product vendor.


The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.

It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.

The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,

ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium

but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.

To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading

support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified

to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW

algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable

by all standard GIF decoders.
